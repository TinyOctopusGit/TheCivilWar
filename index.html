                            <p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act was created by Stephen Douglas to try and make a route for a rail line to go. He created the territories, Kansas and Nebraska. The slave laws in these territories were ruled by popular sovereignty causing pro and anti slavery settlers to rush to Kansas to try and push the results in their favor. The conflict turned violent, causing what is called the Bleeding of Kansas.</p>
